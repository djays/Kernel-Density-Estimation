Main code + steps : main.ipynb
else : report.pdf 

To run the code
You should be able to get started if you have a basic Python3.5+ environment with Jupyter, Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas (used for reporting and tracking results). Alternatively install via requirements.txt.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.5+
2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch 
```
jupyter lab main.ipynb
```
4. Set paths to extracted MNIST and CIFAR100 in the code: CIFAR_100_DIR and MNIST_PICKLE  
5. Set other variables such as NUM_PROCS to control number of processes spawned.
